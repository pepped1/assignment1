Assignment 1


To run, the program needs
-Data about the rooms on campus (rooms.csv)
-Data about availability of rooms on campus (schedule.csv)
-HackTCNJ start date (yyyy-mm-dd)
-HackTCNJ start time (hh:mm)
-HackTCNJ run time (hh:mm)
-number of people attending
-number of people in groups

During execution, the program needs user input to
-choose which rooms to reserve
-choose the name of the new schedule file

Known limitations:
-Does not do anything with group or individual data
-Does not accept start times unless they are on the hour (automatically rounds down to the hour)
-Does not accept run times unless they are on the hour (properly rounds them up or down)
